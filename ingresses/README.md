Ingress is your friend to managing external traffic to services within the cluster. Before we dive into the details, let’s recap what we’ve learned so far. Before Ingress, the Service provides a Load balancer, which is used to distribute the traffic between multiple applications or pods.

Ingress helps to expose the HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside of the cluster.

Ingress enables Path-based and Host-based routing.

Ingress supports Load balancing and SSL termination.
